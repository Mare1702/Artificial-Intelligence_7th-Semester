# Artificial-Intelligence_7th-Semester

Here are contained all the laboratory practises and .pdf reports carried out throughout my artificial intelligence course. 

There are several .csv files contained across all the folders in the repository, this are meant to be used inside the .ipynb notebooks in order to carry out the processing algorithms in wich every practise focused on. 
While any .csv file will be accepted by any of the files in the repository, it should be taken in consideration that:
* A priori Association and distance metrics will only properly work if the .csv file contains   transactinoal data
* From the "Particional Cluster" file forward, numeric data will be required for the           algorithms to work properly
